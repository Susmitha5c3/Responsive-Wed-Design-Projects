      <p><strong>Steven Paul Jobs</strong> (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate and investor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc, chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. </P>
    <p>At age 22, a young Steve Jobs attended the first West Coast Computer Faire, where the Apple II computer debuted in April 1977. A few years later in 1984, Jobs unveiled Apple Computer Corporation's new and first Macintosh along with John Sculley, Apple's president. It was the first commercially successful personal computer to feature a mouse and a graphical user interface. After a power struggle with John Sculley at Apple, Steve Jobs founded NeXT Computer in 1985. Ross Perot invested heavily into the company. Jobs served as the CEO of NeXT Computer Corporation until Apple acquired the company in 1996. He is pictured here in his Palo Alto, Calif., office in 1995.</p>
    <p>By 1984, Apple, Inc. introduced the Macintosh computer to the world. This started a trend of Apple introducing innovative products to the market. Job had issues with Apple and was fired in the late 1980s, but he returned in the late 1990s ( (Lashinsky, 2009). After his return to Apple in 1997, he hired a completely new management team that would turn into his confidants (Lashinsky, 2009). This is around the time when Apple introduced the iMac, the real start of their successful launch of many new and innovative products including the iPod, iTunes, iTouch, iPhone, and iPad over the next approximate decade. The innovation involved in these products has launched Apple into one of the most successful computer and technology companies. </p>
